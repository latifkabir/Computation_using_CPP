    <p>
      <b>ALBANY</b>
      is a C++ program which
      allows the implementation of finite element PDE solvers for a variety of 
      fundamental research applications, including LCM (Laboratory for 
      Computational Mechanics), QCAD (Quantum Computer Aided Design) and FELIX 
      (Finite Element for Land Ice eXperiments).
    </p>

    <p>
      The highlight of Albany is the PDE assembly. The template-based generic 
      programming approach allows developers to just program for residual 
      equations, and all manner of derivatives and polynomial propogations 
      get automatically computed with no additional development effort.
