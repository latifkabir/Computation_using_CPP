      SCVT_MPI <br> Parallel Program for Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations on Spheres
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>SCVT_MPI</b>
      is a C++ program which
      carries out a procedure that produces 
      Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVT's) on the surface of a sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      A CVT is a kind of mesh.  Such meshes can be used for weather
      or climate modeling on the Earth's surface, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses Jonathan Shewchuk's triangle library, which
      can triangulate a set of points in the plane.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program uses the boost library of high-quality arithmetic
      procedures, in particular, it refers to the boost mpi and 
      boost serialization libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program relies on the boost mpi library to implement the parallel
      execution of the algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program relies on the boost serialization library to encode
      a C++ structure as a sequence of bytes that can be recorded in a 
      file or transmitted as a message, which can then be decoded by
      a receiving program to recover the original C++ structure.
