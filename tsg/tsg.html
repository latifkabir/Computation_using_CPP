      TSG <br> TASMANIAN Sparse Grid Library
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TSG</b> 
      includes C++ programs which
      demonstrate the use of the TasmanianSparseGrid (TSG) package,
      which implements routines for working with sparse grids,
      to efficiently estimate integrals or compute interpolants of
      scalar functions of multidimensional arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      TSG can create three kinds of rules:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Global grids, for globally smooth functions;
        </li>
        <li>
          Local polynomial grids, a piecewise polynomial approach 
          for non-smooth functions
        </li>
        <li>
          Wavelet grids, also for non-smooth functions, but this option
          can sometimes achieve better accuracy with fewer points.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      TSG is a family of algorithms for constructing multidimensional
      quadrature and interpolation rules from tensor products of 1-dimensional
      versions of such rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      TSG includes a large variety of 1-dimensional rules, which are generally
      defined, by default, over the interval [-1,+1].  In that case, the 
      multidimensional quadrature and interpolation rules will be defined over
      the hypercube [-1,+1]^d, but a simple linear transformation can be
      carried out by TSG to redefine the linearly redefine the region. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The one-dimensional rules that can be used include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Chebyshev;
        </li>
        <li>
          Clenshaw Curtis;
        </li>
        <li>
          Fejer Type 2;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Chebyshev Type 1;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Chebyshev Type 2;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Gegenbauer;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Hermite;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Jacobi;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Laguerre;
        </li>
        <li>
          Gauss Legendre;
        </li>
        <li>
          Local polynomial;
        </li>
        <li>
          Local polynomial zero;
        </li>
        <li>
          Local wavelet.
        </li>
      </ul>
